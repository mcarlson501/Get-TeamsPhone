# Get-TeamsPhoneToolkit

A community-driven collection of interactive PowerShell scripts, tools, and resources designed to simplify and accelerate the deployment and migration to Microsoft Teams Phone.

Author: Matthew Carlson (Teams Phone Cloud Solutions Architect, Microsoft)

About The Project
The goal of the Get-TeamsPhoneToolkit is to bridge the gap between official Microsoft Learn documentation and real-world execution. While the official documentation provides the "what," this toolkit provides the "how"â€”in the form of curated, interactive, and security-conscious script applications.

This project is a work in progress, geared towards M365 admins, engineers, and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) who want to confidently and efficiently deploy Teams Calling solutions for their organizations and customers. This project assumes you already have a intermidiate understanding of Teams Phone System.

Contributing
